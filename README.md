# Hunger Games Simulator

This repository is meant to serve as a way for people to examine and
contribute to the Hunger Games Simulator on 
[nguh.org](www.nguh.org/tools/hunger_games_simulator).

The simulator logic is implemented mainly in 
[hunger_games_simulator.ts](./hunger_games_simulator.ts),
and the interface in 
[hunger_games_simulator.html](./hunger_games_simulator.html)
and [hunger_games_simulator.sass](./css/hunger_games_simulator.sass).

All other files in this repository are either part of the nguh.org page
template and included here for convenience or created for this repository 
specifically.

The file [simple_server.ts](simple_server.ts) is a simple server that
simulates the nguh.org server.
