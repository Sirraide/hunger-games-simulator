# Hunger Games Simulator

IMPORTANT: Due to how tightly the HGS is integrated into nguh.org, this repository
is likely to not be up to date or contain bugs. If you wish to contribute to it anyway,
you are welcome to do so, just be aware that this is probably not the latest version.

This repository is meant to serve as a way for people to examine and
contribute to the Hunger Games Simulator on 
[nguh.org](https://www.nguh.org/tools/hunger_games_simulator).

The simulator logic is implemented mainly in 
[hunger_games_simulator.ts](./hunger_games_simulator.ts),
and the interface in 
[hunger_games_simulator.html](./hunger_games_simulator.html)
and [hunger_games_simulator.sass](./css/hunger_games_simulator.sass).

All other files in this repository are either part of the nguh.org page
template and included here for convenience or created for this repository 
specifically.

The file [simple_server.ts](simple_server.ts) is a simple server that
simulates the nguh.org server.
